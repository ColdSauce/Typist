# Typographer

Warning, this is a work in progress. We are going to make it so that this works with child components soon. Right now, you have to manually pass in the text as a prop which is a bit janky. 

Typographer is a React component that simulates a person typing.

## Installation

`npm install --save typographer`

## Usage
`<Typographer text="some text you want to write" speed = {20}/>`

Speed is in miliseconds.
